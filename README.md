# Li-Ion-Visualizer
UTK Li-ion visualizer tool

This tool was created under the mentorship of Dr. Doug Aaron and Dr. Matthew Mench
 - Designed by Preetam Sharma and Anirban Roy
 - Written in Python by Thomas Donahue and Will Buziak
 
 ## Dependencies
 python 3.9
- plotly

This tool currently runs through an html webpage. The html page (html/chart.html) was originally generated by plotly (src/main.py) this reads the data and generates a 3D interactive plot. The html page can then be manipulated further (html/index.html) to constrain the figure to a portion of the screen and can display other aspects in the other regions of the page.

 ## Workflow
 - The src/main.py python script will generate the html/chart.html file
 ```
 python3 src/main.py
 ```
 - The html/index.html file uses the figure generated with html/chart.html and places it within an iframe 
 - placing the index.html into your webbrowser will display the interactive 3d chart
