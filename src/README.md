# Li-Ion-Visualizer
UTK Li-ion visualizer tool

This tool was created under the mentorship of Dr. Doug Aaron and Dr. Matthew Mench
 - Designed by Preetam Sharma and Anirban Roy
 - Written in Python by Thomas Donahue and Will Buziak

## Build Status
Main creates chart.html which holds the 3-D plot.
Index, the main page of the site, holds an iframe of chart.html.

Issues/further action:
Create area below the chart which displays a link when the user hovers over a data point on the plot
 
 ## Dependencies
 Note: By running the executable file, your computer should not require python to be installed, nor any dependencies required when running it locally.
 
 In order to run the main.py script, it is recommended that you are running python3 and all dependencies can be installed with pip.
  - The Interface was written using pandas and plotly.

## Argument for plotly - delete this later
    - chart looks nice
    - hover over point shows data associated with the point
    - plotly supports hover callback funtions so link area below chart may be straight forward? JS might be needed for this which I don't have experience in. See https://dash.plotly.com/vtk/click-hover
    - plot area is customizable. See https://plotly.com/python/3d-scatter-plots/ and https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.scatter_3d
